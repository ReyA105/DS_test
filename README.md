# Practicing data science techniques to look at the Spotify Data 
 Data set can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks 


Initially, made this just to look at different trena across the years of music. 

I'm possibly looking into if I can build a ML algo for music recommendations on what I currently have liked on spotify using the data set that includes genres for each song.
